Just walked out of Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning. Man, my brain's a popcorn jumble right now. Tom Cruise or maybe it was Ethan Hunt? was like this human bullet, dodging things faster than the popcorn I dumped all over the floor. Every twist, one after another—felt like twisting my back on those uncomfortable seats. Seriously, why doesn’t popcorn ever taste as good in my mouth as it does all over my hoodie?

There’s this scene where they’re hanging from a helicopter - or was it a train? - and I swear, my heart wasn’t even in my chest. It was somewhere crammed between stale popcorn bits under my chair. The soundtrack was like a heartbeat, so loud, pounding like the dude behind me chomping his candy like a hungry bear. How did they even manage to stitch these fragments into a  ? It's like a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are alive and dance when you’re not looking.

> Speaking of which, I just remembered someone asked if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . But man, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   in a theater is like skydiving without a parachute — it’s all rush, no second chance. One moment, you’re holding your breath. Next moment, Tom or Ethan — whichever — is running again like he's late for a hot date with chaos. My brain feels like a blender. Everything's swirling, the action scenes mixed with the anxiety of my bladder.

How in the world did they 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 the underwater scene, or was it underground? Can’t be sure. My mind’s all puddled, like trying to remember a dream I never had. The whole thing’s a blur, kind of like the time I tried to make scrambled eggs in the microwave and it exploded. Just flash after flash — red wire or blue wire, and BAM, my brain's trying to process both! Gotta re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, maybe 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when my brain's not mush.

And that motorcycle chase... was it on mars? It felt like it. Gravity was just... an opinion. They hit the throttle, and I swear every popcorn kernel jumped a foot in the air. Was it ever not possible to breathe? Need to text this, maybe in another few days when the dizziness stops and I remember what sleep's like.

int main() {
    // thought processing error
    int thoughts[] = {1, 2, 3}; // scrambled eggs
    for(int i = 0; i < sizeof(thoughts)/sizeof(thoughts[0]); i++) {
        // heart_rate = 0;
        std::cout << Need more popcorn
;
    }
    // Just, wow.
    return 0;
}
